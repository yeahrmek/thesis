This thesis is devoted to the problem of building large-scale models based on
Gaussian Processes (GP).
We consider two cases: (1) the data sets in which input points lie on a multi-dimension grid,
and (2) general data sets without any specific structure.
For the first case, we develop a technique for calculating an exact inference for the GP regression
model by applying tensor arithmetic that efficiently handles the structure of the data set.
The proposed approach can also deal with missing values, which are often a problem in practical applications.
For the second case of unstructured data sets, we developed a kernel approximation technique
based on an integral representation of the kernel function and special quadrature rules.
We show that our approach is a generalization of several prominent papers in this area.
The experimental section demonstrates superiority of the proposed technique compared to other
methods.
Finally, we develop several methods based on the proposed large-scale models for
three different problems: tensor completion, density estimate and simultaneous localization
and mapping.
This very diverse set of problems demonstrate how our models can be built into different pipelines and show some advantages of this approach.
